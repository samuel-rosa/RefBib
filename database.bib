  Abstract                 = {Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) is a type of stratiﬁed random sampling that accurately represents the variability of environmental covariates in feature space. As the smallest possible sample is important for efﬁcient ﬁeld work, what is the optimal sample size for digital soil mapping? An optimal sample size accurately represents the variability in the environmental covariates and provides enough samples for predictive models. This paper brieﬂy reviews cLHS and investigates different sample sizes for representing ﬁve environmental covari- ates in a 30,000-ha complex landscape in the Great Basin of southwestern Utah. The cLHS code was run in Matlab TM (Mathworks, 2008) and statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical language (R Development Core Team, 2009). Graphical analysis for continuous data and chi-square analysis of categorical data suggested optimal sample size for this study area is approximately 200 to 300 (0.05–0.1%).},

  Abstract                 = {More effective methodologies to determine the soil class distribution must be evaluated in order to meet the demand for soil maps at regional and global scales. In this study, logistic regressions were used as predictive models in an application of Digital Soil Mapping. The models were derived from an existing soil map as dependent variable and terrain attributes as independent variables. The probability of finding soil classes in the landscape at the 1st and 2nd Categorical Level of the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (SiBCS) was determined. The quality of the predicted map was tested using a contingency matrix. Approximately 85 % of the Acrisols (Argissolos) were correctly predicted, in relation to the original map. Of the hydromorphic soils, 75 % were correctly predicted. The prediction was inaccurate for classes in very similar positions in the landscape. It was also found that the non-representative soil classes of the landscape were not properly spatialized, due to sensitivity of the logistic models to the relative proportion of the samples used to adjust the models.},

The aim of this study was to use the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of predictors in the multinomial logistic regression (MLR) used in soil mapping. Nine environmental covariates, related to the relief factor of soil formation, were derived from a digital elevation model and named the original variables, which were submitted to PCA and transformed into principal components (PC). The MLR were developed using the terrain attributes and the PC as explanatory variables. The soil map generated from three PC (65.6% of the original variance) had a kappa index of 37.3%, lower than the 48.5% achieved by the soil map generated from all nine original variables.},

The assessment of the resolution with the highest variability was evaluated through the application of the Morlet mother wavelet. The results were analyzed from the wavelet coefficients plotted in isograms and scalograms, and indicate that remote sensors with spatial resolution between 32 and 40 m should be used in researches considering terrain attributes as slope, profile curvature and topographic wetness index, or even environmental phenomena related to them.

The topographic attributes elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature and topographic index, derived from a digital elevation model, and the indexes of clay minerals, iron oxide and normalized difference vegetation, derived from a Landsat7 image, were combined and evaluated for their ability to discriminate soils of an area at the northwest of Rio de Janeiro State. The Java neural simulator and the backpropagation learning algorithm were used. The maps generated by each of the six tested sets of variables were compared with reference points for determining the rating accuracy. This comparison showed that the map produced with the use of all the variables reached a performance (73.81% of agreement) superior to maps produced by other sets of variables. Possible sources of error in the use of this approach are mainly related to the great lithological heterogeneity of the area, which hindered the establishment of a more realistic model of environmental correlation. The approach can help make the soil survey in Brazil faster and less subjective.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most important scientific challenges of digital soil mapping is to develop generic models that may allow the soils to be predicted over large areas. Our objective here is to quantify the relationships between the soils and their #environment# to further our understanding of the rules of soil distribution. The study was conducted in the Armorican Massif (30,000 km2), a metamorphic area of western France where soils formed under conditions of poor drainage due to water accumulation within slopes and/or low infiltration. Field investigations on a 2-ha site and detailed soil map (1:25,000) analysis, were used to compare quantitative relationships between hydromorphic soils and soil-forming factors of topography, climate and geology. Soil surveys at both scales revealed a continuous succession downslope-upslope of soils with fluvic properties, soils with glossic and/or albic features, soils with other redoximorphic features (RFs) and soils without RF. These soils are distributed along slopes in the same order with only variations in their relative extent. At a single site, the soil hydromorphy significantly correlated with terrain attributes extracted from the surface topography of elevation above the stream bank, ES (r2=0.79) and the compound topographic index, CTI (r2=0.62). Greater correlations were obtained by using attributes from the topography of the saprolite upper boundary, that possibly better-explained water movement within hillslopes. The total variance of regional data accounted for by the first two principal components (PCs) was 74%. The first PC explained 52% of the variance and exhibited a pattern associated with the presence or absence of RFs in soils. Environmental factors having the highest (absolute) values for this factor are not only mean slope gradient but also geologic substrate, net rainfall (NR) and uplift ratio (UR). These results revealed that other factors than topography have to be considered to account for the range of processes leading to soil hydromorphy over a region. Because these processes act at different spatial scales, multi-scale approaches are required not only to detect the patterns of soil distribution but also to develop generic and high-resolution prediction models for the characterisation of large areas.},

These digital data were analysed using commercially available GIS and image processing software. Unsupervised, supervised and simple knowledge-based classifications were used in the preliminary stage to develop visual representations of soil-landscape patterns and to plan for field data collection. As more was learned about the survey area from data collection, a knowledge-based decision-tree classification model was built and refined. The resulting maps were evaluated qualitatively by local experts and quantitatively using accuracy assessment, and showed good agreement between predicted and observed map units. Continued technological advancements in spatial data and improved GIS and modelling expertise of soil scientists should increase the accuracy and efficiency of the soil survey process.},

  Abstract                 = {In this Chapter, we describe the steps followed to build and improve the Soil Geographical Database of Eurasia at scale 1:1,000,000 and suggest automatic soil mapping techniques to improve it. The work started in 1952 with the compilation of materials provided by the contributing countries to publish the Soil Map of the European Communities at scale 1:1,000,000 in 1985. From then on, it was computerised, geo-referenced, structured to form a geographic database, enriched using archives of the original materials, extended geographically and thematically, harmonised over country borders, updated and documented. Despite this streamline of development and enhancements, it has limitations inherent to the initial objective of publishing a paper map and to the wide variety of views on soil mapping that were brought together from the community of contributors. The next logical step would thus be to improve the Soil Database by using existing detailed soil information and newly European-wide available satellite data and digital elevation models (DEMs). Existing soil maps at larger scale available in some parts of Europe could be used as training references to assess the morphometric (relief) and spectral characteristics of the Soil Mapping Units (SMUs) from DEM and satellite images, and the results extrapolated beyond to the surrounding areas and compared with the present delineation included in the 1:1,000,000 Soil Database. The Limousin Region of France was chosen as a test area but other geomorphologically diverse and representative areas in Europe should be included as well. This work is in progress but more partners will be needed in a collaborative project effort to establish a multi-scale European Soil Information System.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe an approach for digital mapping of soil properties based on dual use of secondary information. In the first stage, multivariate secondary information is used to stratify a landscape for sampling. A new clustering algorithm was developed for this, which allows conducting spatially constrained cluster analysis using mixed categorical and continuous secondary attributes. The stratification is used to optimise sampling by constrained spatial simulated annealing (CSSA). Sampled values and correlated secondary attributes are then used in simple kriging with varying local means (SKLMs) to perform final mapping. We applied this method to mapping of soil carbon stock (CS) in the top 0.3 m of soil. Using secondary information greatly reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) of CS prediction as compared with ordinary kriging (OK) of sampled CS alone. When sampling intensity was decreased, RMSE increased more with OK than by using SKLM for local prediction. Among the ancillary variables, on-the-go sensed soil electrical conductivity was most useful for CS mapping. Further research should focus on developing a generic framework for thematic soil mapping at different scales. More standardised procedures are required for processing of secondary information, optimising sampling designs and performing local prediction to minimise cost and achieve high precision.},

  Abstract                 = {Many countries completed large scale (1:5,000 – 1:25,000) soil surveys decades ago, and have since used their thematic and geographic information to derive thematic soil property layers of the same or smaller scale (1:100,000 and smaller). The new layers are often simply aggregates of the original soil polygons and inherit the same geographic relationships that were delineated in the original data source. In reality, this approach does not use all information of the input data. Instead of aggregating existing maps, the original, non-interpreted ﬁeld survey point data can be gathered and used for deriving new property layers. The paper aims to summarize a soil database development project using legacy data for a transboundary area, representing two different systems of data collection, storage and management. Recent and archived soil proﬁle data have been collected, including monitoring sites, soil nutrient status campaign data for different periods, and recorded soil proﬁles from previous soil mapping activities. These data sources have een transformed to have a common theoretical basis using commonly accepted pedotransfer rules and an integrated proﬁle database has been formed. It was used to interpolate soil information and develop soil property maps and layers repre- senting the WRB diagnostic properties and horizons. The creation of the property layers was based on statistical/geostatistical interpolations of the soil proﬁle database using DEM derivatives, SPOT and Landsat satellite images as covariates to provide information for the natural setting of the area. The interpolated values for the numeric variables were estimated using regression kriging, while the classiﬁed variables were calculated using the maximum likelihood classiﬁcation algorithm. It was concluded, that the development of WRB diagnostic criteria database is feasible using raw data of different origin and a set of harmonization and digital soil mapping tools.},

A regression-kriging procedure was used to spatially predict the organic matter content for the whole of Hungary. The goal of the study was to characterise the performance of regression analysis using satellite and terrain data as a potential method for soil variable mapping and to derive a soil-organic matter content map for Hungary. Eight-day composites of Terra MODIS were used (1-8 May, 2000 and 1-8 Sept, 2000, with 500-m resolution, channels 1-7 and 21). The satellite image layers were spectrally improved. Numerous terrain variables were derived from the SRTM-30 and were used as input variables to the regression. Logarithmic and square root transformations were done for some of the layers and variables to achieve normality. Via these preprocessing and transformation algorithms a new integrated satellite and terrain database was created. This database was used for estimating the soil organic matter content by regression analysis and kriging. The statistical correlations and the percentages of variation explained by the regression models were always significant. However, their values were relatively low.},

  Abstract                 = {Harmonised and standardised spatial reference data are increasingly essential to support environmental policies (e.g. Soil Thematic Strategy). However, soil databases often appear heterogeneous, lack common geographical references or are poorly documented (metadata). Analysis based on such data sets may generate inconsistent results that will not benefit the users. The opportunity to review and adapt soil-mapping practices came with the initiative taken by the European Commission to position the establishment and operation of an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe under a legal framework, the INSPIRE Directive. The proposed Directive includes minimum requirements for harmonising, documenting and disseminating spatial data. Member States will be asked to establish and operate infrastructures for different spatial themes in accordance with a set of technical guidelines still to be defined and approved. Over the last 10 years, the European Soil Bureau Network has gained much experience in establishing harmonised soil data for Europe and can, therefore, provide an ideal area of experimentation for the practical implementation of the recommended technical guidelines. This chapter reviews some of the changes to be made to the 1:1,000,000 scale European Soil Database to fulfil the INSPIRE requirements.},

In conclusion, it seems that adequate measures lack the ability to detect and quantify logical inconsistencies resulting from joining and harmonisation of existing maps. Additionally, indicators need to be developed that assess the semantic quality of maps while accounting for the taxonomic distance between the map units. Users' perspectives lead to a different view on map quality. Some minimal data sets of error are proposed that will enable users to incorporate soil map uncertainty into their applications.},

  Abstract                 = {The unique selling point of pedometricians still is close to their cradle: ability to map. Irrespective of the many scientific achievements one can ask if offering mapping ability, allbeit in various contexts, is all a pedometrician can do to bring forward soil science's broader agenda. This paper identifies, within some of the hotter issues on the soil science agenda, activities that need the input of pedometricians. Digital soil mapping (DSM) has reached maturity although some issues like the optimal use of legacy data still need attention. The necessary shift from DSM to digital soil function mapping implies an increased need for process knowledge in mapping, but also an increased focus of pedometricians on the strengthening of process models. Most quality issues related to DSM have a counterpart in process modelling, and some of these issues need elaboration to construct well-calibrated and complete models, e.g. by making motivated choices between the inclusion of processes or model reduction. Reaching out to stakeholders is also an issue of increasing interest, as these are confronted with uncertain concurrent models to evaluate future scenarios. Questions are raised such as: Does the need for a state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach imply a choice for one model and how should this be made, or is SOTA implementable as some weighted average of screened concurrent models. Can observations and model results be combined in decision making and what techniques are needed. The above issues are illustrated with existing examples and new material from soil science and beyond. As DSM and process modelling share common ground, mutual benefits can be expected at the interface of both research fields such as (i) increased usage of process knowledge in DSM and (ii) probabilistic approaches to less well understood soil processes. Stakeholders will profit from the development of decision frameworks to choose applicable DSM-techniques and the increased application of ensembles of DSM-methods and models to narrow prediction error bandwidths. Additionally, they will profit from the development of decision support systems filled with outcomes of scenario studies of multiple, uncertain, and concurrent models as these provide an interesting alternative to the application of one selected model.},

Western pedometrists stress the scientific priority and principal importance of Hans Jenny?s book (1941) for the emergence and development of predictive soil mapping. In this paper, we demonstrate that Vasily Dokuchaev explicitly defined the central idea and statement of the problem of contemporary predictive soil mapping in the year 1886. Then, we reconstruct the history of the soil formation equation from 1899 to 1941. We argue that Jenny adopted the soil formation equation from Sergey Zakharov, who published it in a well-known fundamental textbook in 1927. It is encouraging that this issue was clarified in 2011, the anniversary year for publications of Dokuchaev and Jenny.},

Terrain parameters, such as elevation, distance to stream, flow accumulation, and topographic wetness index, were the variables that best explained soil distribution. Stratification by drainage classes did not have significant effect. Simplification of the original legend increased the accuracy of the method on predicting soil distribution.},

High-resolution auxiliary data such as the soil electrical conductivity (SEC), detailed digital elevation models (DEM), and aerial photographs (APs) and their derivatives carry information on different soil parameters. SEC has very high correlation with soil texture, DEM contain valuable information on soil moisture regime and landscape genesis, and AP carry information on topsoil total organic carbon, TOC. We have developed a system that assists in identifying which auxiliary dataset should be used to determine each map unit boundary width, and thereafter express the boundary as a transition zone between two or more soil types. The method is developed using data from a soil survey on the island of Funen in Denmark and the concept is illustrated in a small strip in this area. A soil database with information on modal soils expresses the degree of drainage, texture and topsoil TOC in each of the mapping units, and we can thereby determine which parameters the bounding map units differ on, and in that way also which dataset should be used for calculating the boundary width.},

  Abstract                 = {The history of digital soil mapping and modeling (DSMM) is marked by adoption of new mapping tools and techniques, data management systems, innovative delivery of soil data, and methods to analyze, integrate, and visualize soil and environmental datasets. DSMM studies are diverse with specialized, mathematical prototype models tested on limited geographic regions and/or datasets and simpler, operational DSMM used for routine mapping over large soil regions. Research-focused DSMM contrasts with need-driven DSMM and agency-operated soil surveys. Since there is no universal equation or digital soil prediction model that fits all regions and purposes the proposed strategy is to characterize recent DSMM approaches to provide recommendations for future needs at local, national and global scales. Such needs are not solely soil-centered, but consider broader issues such as land and water quality, carbon cycling and global climate change, sustainable land management, and more. A literature review was conducted to review 90 DSMM publications from two high-impact international soil science journals ? Geoderma and Soil Science Society of America Journal. A selective approach was used to identify published studies that cover the multi-factorial DSMM space. The following criteria were used (i) soil properties, (ii) sampling setup, (iii) soil geographic region, (iv) spatial scale, (v) distribution of soil observations, (vi) incorporation of legacy/historic data, (vii) methods/model type, (viii) environmental covariates, (ix) quantitative and pedological knowledge, and (x) assessment method. Strengths and weaknesses of current DSMM, their potential to be operationalized in soil mapping/modeling programs, research gaps, and future trends are discussed. Modeling of soils in 3D space and through time will require synergistic strategies to converge environmental landscape data and denser soil datasets. There are needs for more sophisticated technologies to measure soil properties and processes at fine resolution and with accuracy. Although there are numerous quantitative models rooted in factorial models that predict soil properties with accuracy in select geographic regions they lack consistency in terms of environmental input data, soil properties, quantitative methods, and evaluation strategies. DSMM requires merging of quantitative, geographic and pedological expertise and all should be ideally in balance.},

  Abstract                 = {Real soil-landscapes are complex consisting of an inextricable mix of patterns and noise varying continuously in the space-time continuum. Soils and parent material show gradual variations in the horizontal and vertical planes forming three-dimensional (3D) bodies that are commonly anisotropic. There is no real beginning and end point in soil-landscapes because environmental conditions are dynamically changed through water flow, biogeochemical processes and human activities. The strengths of soil-landscape modelling lies in hypothesis testing, understanding causal linkages between environmental factors and their interrelationships within a spatial and temporal explicit context. To develop virtual soil-landscape models entails: (i) conceptualisation, that is defining the model framework (e.g. finite space elements); (ii) reconstruction, that is describing and quantifying underlying conditions and behaviour and (iii) scientific visualisation (SciVis), that is abstracting real soil-landscapes into a format that we can comprehend and that helps us to understand the complexity of soil-landscapes. The primary objective in data visualisation is to gain insight into an information space by mapping data onto graphical primitives. Capabilities and limitations of SciVis and virtual reality (VR) techniques are discussed in this chapter. Only recently 3D soil-landscape models have been emerging. We present a case study that translated the spatio-temporal water-table dynamics of a flatwood soil-landscape in Florida into a virtual domain using a geostatistical method to reconstruct the soil-landscape and Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) enhanced with External Authoring Interface (EAI) for visualisation and implementation of interactive functions. Just as maps can visually enhance the spatial understanding of phenomena, interactive spatio-temporal applications can enhance our understanding of complex environmental systems and the underlying transport processes driving soil and water quality.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses empirical and analytical rules to select a suitable grid resolution for output maps and based on the inherent properties of the input data. The choice of grid resolution was related with the cartographic and statistical concepts: scale, computer processing power, positional accuracy, size of delineations, inspection density, spatial autocorrelation structure and complexity of terrain. These were further related with the concepts from the general statistics and information theory such as Nyquist frequency concept from signal processing and equations to estimate the probability density function. Selection of grid resolution was demonstrated using four datasets: (1) GPS positioning data--the grid resolution was related to the area of circle described by the error radius, (2) map of agricultural plots--the grid resolution was related to the size of smallest and narrowest plots, (3) point dataset from soil mapping--the grid resolution was related to the inspection density, nugget variation and range of spatial autocorrelation and (4) contour map used for production of digital elevation model--the grid resolution was related with the spacing between the contour lines i.e. complexity of terrain. It was concluded that no ideal grid resolution exists, but rather a range of suitable resolutions. One should at least try to avoid using resolutions that do not comply with the effective scale or inherent properties of the input dataset. Three standard grid resolutions for output maps were finally recommended: (a) the coarsest legible grid resolution--this is the largest resolution that we should use in order to respect the scale of work and properties of a dataset; (b) the finest legible grid resolution--this is the smallest grid resolution that represents 95% of spatial objects or topography; and (c) recommended grid resolution--a compromise between the two. Objective procedures to derive the true optimal grid resolution that maximizes the predictive capabilities or information content of a map are further discussed. This methodology can now be integrated within a GIS package to help inexperienced users select a suitable grid resolution without doing extensive data preprocessing.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses the characteristics of regression-kriging (RK), its strengths and limitations, and illustrates these with a simple example and three case studies. RK is a spatial interpolation technique that combines a regression of the dependent variable on auxiliary variables (such as land surface parameters, remote sensing imagery and thematic maps) with simple kriging of the regression residuals. It is mathematically equivalent to the interpolation method variously called “Universal Kriging” (UK) and “Kriging with External Drift” (KED), where auxiliary predictors are used directly to solve the kriging weights. The advantage of RK is the ability to extend the method to a broader range of regression techniques and to allow separate interpretation of the two interpolated components. Data processing and interpretation of results are illustrated with three case studies covering the national territory of Croatia. The case studies use land surface parameters derived from combined Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and contour-based digital elevation models and multitemporal-enhanced vegetation indices derived from the MODIS imagery as auxiliary predictors. These are used to improve mapping of two continuous variables (soil organic matter content and mean annual land surface temperature) and one binary variable (presence of yew). In the case of mapping temperature, a physical model is used to estimate values of temperature at unvisited locations and RK is then used to calibrate the model with ground observations. The discussion addresses pragmatic issues: implementation of RK in existing software packages, comparison of RK with alternative interpolation techniques, and practical limitations to using RK. The most serious constraint to wider use of RK is that the analyst must carry out various steps in different software environments, both statistical and GIS.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the limitations of soil data is essential for both managing environmental systems effectively and encouraging the responsible use of soil data. Explicit assessment of the uncertainties associated with soil data, and their storage in a soil database are therefore important. In practice, users will not want to separate [`]uncertain data' from [`]certain data' and will therefore require a single database that meets all the requirements of a conventional database, as well as the ability to handle uncertain data specifically. This chapter presents a framework that facilitates the storage of information about soil-data quality, including the uncertainties associated with soil data, in a conventional database design. It comprises a methodology for classifying data according to their attribute scale, which influences the structure of an uncertainty model, and their space-time variability, which determines the need for autocorrelation functions in describing uncertainty. In terms of the former, the key distinctions are among real numbers on a continuous domain, real or integer numbers on a discrete domain, categorical data and narrative data. In terms of the latter, the key distinctions are among data that are constant in space and time (e.g. universal constants); data that vary in time, but not in space; data that vary in space but not in time; and data that vary both in time and space. Thus, we distinguish 13 [`]data types' to which individual datasets may be assigned. This simplifies the process of assessing uncertainties about soil data because characteristic uncertainty models can be defined for each data type. In general terms, an uncertain soil variable is completely specified by its probability distribution function (pdf). However, the complexity of a pdf varies with the 13 [`]data types' identified. For example, the (cumulative) pdf of an uncertain numerical constant is simply a nondecreasing function on the real line. The database stores this function or some parameters of it, such as the mean and variance. Other data types are associated with more complex pdfs. For example, an uncertain categorical soil map requires the probability of each soil type occurring at any location to be defined (local uncertainty), as well as the spatial dependencies between these probabilities at multiple locations (spatial uncertainty). In practice, the complexity of the joint pdf will make it difficult or impossible to identify. Assumptions (such as a stationarity assumption) are therefore required to reduce the number of model parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital soil mapping makes extensive use of auxiliary information, such as that contained in remote sensing images and digital elevation models. However, it cannot do without taking samples of the soil itself. Therefore, methods and guidelines need to be developed that assist users in designing spatial sample configurations for use in digital soil mapping. Existing geostatistical methods are insufficient because these typically have been developed for situations in which there is no auxiliary information. In this chapter, we explore how the existing methods may be extended to the case in which the auxiliary information is spatially exhaustive and where soil mapping is done using universal kriging. We develop and illustrate a methodology that optimizes the spatial configuration of observations by minimizing the spatially averaged universal kriging variance. The universal kriging variance incorporates trend estimation error as well as spatial interpolation error. Hence, the optimized sample configuration strikes a balance between an optimal distribution of observations in feature and geographic space. The results show that optimal distribution in feature space prevails over optimal distribution in geographic space when the stochastic component of the universal kriging model is weakly spatially autocorrelated. It also prevails when the total number of observations is small. In all other cases, the optimal configuration is close to that obtained with minimization of only the spatial interpolation error. Application to a variety of real-world cases with multiple predictors and different spatial dependence structures is needed to support and generalise these preliminary findings.},

Our survey substituted environmental analysis and DTA for traditional air photo interpretation to provide a continuous land unit coverage over the islands. DTA was used to derive mapping rules for land units, their component vegetation classes and soil families from secondary survey site observations and distributed environmental data. The mapping was tested on a legacy data set. The environmental variables used are: elevation, slope, latitude, longitude, landform pattern class, wetness class, static wetness index, erosion or deposition index, Landsat TM band 5:7 and vegetation cover class extracted from digital topographic 1:50,000-scale mapping. We needed to reduce the number of the resulting land unit classes derived from historical surveys into nine classes so as to produce a more meaningful mapping. This was achieved by generalising the component vegetation and soil units of the land unit classes thus producing the broader land unit classification. This procedure dovetails well with the current survey approach in which surveyors often develop more detailed classification systems than can be accurately mapped. We recommend a predictive mapping approach based on explicit mapping rules that integrate available land resources information and facilitate production of upgradeable maps.},

  Abstract                 = {We developed models from soil profile descriptions and GIS landscape analysis to estimate the spatial distribution of soil properties to assist soil scientists with soil-landscape information. Soil profile descriptions were obtained within soil survey projects in the Mojave Desert of southeastern California, USA. Sites were located on broad alluvial fans. Soil development varied from young soils with little or no soil development to well-developed soils on older alluvial fan remnants. We obtained a set of profile descriptions (n=264) from the traditional ongoing fieldwork. The location of these sample points was determined by soil scientist judgment of combinations of soil-forming factors. The project area is sparsely vegetated and access is relatively unimpaired in most areas. We feel that these purposive samples represent the range of the soil-forming factors and that sample location bias will be low. Although this bias is not measurable. We wanted to see if we could make use of these data. We developed models from these data and evaluated the performance of the models using the measured values at randomly located sites not used to fit the models. The models estimated selected soil characteristics continuously in a 30-m raster over the project area. The response variables that we modelled were soil genetic features that are used as diagnostic properties in USDA Soil Taxonomy, for example particle-size class, presence or absence of argillic horizon. Soil profiles and landscape features were described at 97 randomly located field sites within a portion of the active soil survey project. Explanatory variable information was developed for each of these sites through GIS extraction from digital elevation model data, landform derivatives, band-ratio satellite images and geomorphologic data. Model estimates for particle-size class were correct or within one class of the correct class for 73% of sample points. Models for depth to soil features had a range of performance. The best fitting model estimated the depth to secondary carbonates within 20 cm of actual depths for 71% of sample points, which contained carbonates. The model for depth to calcic horizon performed less well, while the model for depth to argillic was slightly less reliable. The model for presence or absence of calcic horizon was the most reliable logistic model. Soils on millions of hectares will be mapped in this general area in the future and we are trying to increase mapping efficiency and depth of understanding of soil-landscape relationships. Model development techniques will be adapted and applied to adjacent areas in the future. Further work will require more field data (to document the response variables) and more complete soil-forming factor spatial data. New soil survey products may result from these continuous raster estimates of soil properties. These model outputs are intended to augment and guide field soil survey data collection, not replace it.},

  Abstract                 = {The 1:50,000 national soil survey of the Netherlands, completed in the early 1990s after more than three decades of mapping, is gradually becoming outdated. Large-scale changes in land and water management that took place after the field surveys have had a great impact on the soil. Especially oxidation of peat soils has resulted in a substantial decline of these soils. The aim of this research was to update the national soil map for the province of Drenthe (2680 km2) without additional fieldwork through digital soil mapping using legacy soil data. Multinomial logistic regression was used to quantify the relationship between ancillary variables and soil group. Special attention was given to model-building as this is perhaps the most crucial step in digital soil mapping. A framework for building a logistic regression model was taken from the literature and adapted for the purpose of soil mapping. The model-building process was guided by pedological expert knowledge to ensure that the final regression model is not only statistically sound but also pedologically plausible. We built separate models for the ten major map units, representing the main soil groups, of the national soil map for the province of Drenthe. The calibrated models were used to estimate the probability of occurrence of soil groups on a 25 m grid. Shannon entropy was used to quantify the uncertainty of the updated soil map, and the updated soil map was validated by an independent probability sample. The theoretical purity of the updated map was 67%. The estimated actual purity of the updated map, as assessed by the validation sample, was 58%, which is 6% larger than the actual purity of the national soil map. The discrepancy between theoretical and actual purity might be explained by the spatial clustering of the soil profile observations used to calibrate the multinomial logistic regression models and by the age difference between calibration and validation observations.},

  Abstract                 = {This study compared the efficiency of geostatistical digital soil mapping (DSM) with conventional soil mapping (CSM) for updating soil class and property maps of a cultivated peatland in the Netherlands. For digital soil class mapping, the generalized linear geostatistical model was used. Digital mapping of the soil organic matter (SOM) content and peat thickness was done by universal kriging. The conventional soil class map was created by free survey, while the property maps were created with the representative profile description (RPD) and map unit means (MUM) methods. For each method, we computed the effort invested in the mapping in terms of the sampling and cost densities. The accuracies of the created soil maps were estimated from independent probability sample data. The results showed that for DSM, the cost density could be reduced by a factor of three compared with CSM without compromising accuracy. The map purity of both maps was around 55%. For conventional soil property mapping, the MUM maps were more accurate than the RPD maps. For SOM, CSM-MUM (RMSE 7.5%) performed better than DSM (RMSE 12.1%), although accuracy differences were not significant. For peat thickness, DSM (RMSE 23.3 cm) performed slightly better than CSM-MUM (RMSE 24.9 cm). Despite the differences in accuracy being small, the digital soil property maps were produced more efficiently. The cost density was a factor of 3.5 smaller. We conclude that for updating conventional soil maps in the Dutch peatlands, geostatistical DSM can be more efficient, although not necessarily more accurate, than CSM.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital soil mapping requires simple, straight-forward methods that can be easily implemented into daily activities of soil survey. The Optimum Index Factor (OIF) was developed by Chavez et al. (1982, 1984) as a method for determining the three-band combination that maximizes the variability in a particular multispectral scene. The OIF is based on the amount of total variance and correlation within and between all possible band combinations in the dataset. Although the OIF method was developed for Landsat TM data, the concept and methodology are applicable to any multilayer dataset. We used the OIF method in a subset area of the initial soil survey of the Duchesne Area, Utah, USA, to help determine which combination of data layers would be most useful for modeling soil distribution. Unique multiband images created from layers of multiple data types (elevation and remote sensing derivatives) were evaluated using the OIF method to determine which data layers would maximize the biophysical variability in the study area. A multiband image was created from the optimum combinations of data layers and used for classiﬁ- cation and modeling in ERDAS Imagine. The output from the classiﬁcation and modeling are being evaluated as pre-maps for soil mapping activities in the study area.},

  Abstract                 = {Wet and saline soils have been recognized as an important and complex component of wetland ecosystems in arid environments. Analysis and classification of remotely sensed spectral data is an effective method for discerning the spatial and temporal variability of soils. The East Shore Area (ESA) of the Great Salt Lake soil survey update is focused on updating soil map units containing wet and saline soils. The ESA provides a unique environment for the use of remotely sensed spectral data for map unit refinement because of low relief and a large extent of soils that are wet and saline to various degrees. Map units in the ESA containing wet and saline soils were updated and refined using Landsat 7 imagery. Five land-cover classes are related to dominant soil types that vary in soil wetness, salinity, calcium carbonate concentration and vegetation cover type. Supervised classification of the imagery was performed using the five land cover classes. The final classification resulted in 14 land cover classes, including nine additional classes that help describe the variability in the original five classes. The classification results were validated using visual inspection in the field, a priori knowledge of the area and an error matrix. The results of the classification were used to enhance original soil map units and calculate map unit composition in the final soil mapping process. This information was then incorporated into the updated soil map. Temporal variation in land cover classes has the potential to be considered in map-unit refinement to reflect the dynamic nature of the margins of the Great Salt Lake, Utah.},

Apart from the spatial challenges that often have to be faced in map integration the semantics of datasets have to be well understood for successful data integration. So-called #ontology-based# approaches for the semantic integration of multi-source geographical datasets may be used to give a firm conceptual basis to digital soil mapping from multi-scale, multi-source geographic data. This chapter explores the use of ontologies in semantic data integration. A first version of an approach for ontology-based data integration for soil-landscape mapping is presented consisting of semantic factoring, ontology definition, reference model construction and data integration. This approach is illustrated with the semantic integration of a small-scale (1:400,000) soil-geomorphic map with a geological map at 1:50,000 scale of the Antequera area in Spain. Comparison of the results of our approach to semantic integration with an Antequera geo-pedological legend designed to map soil-landforms in this area at 1:50,000 scale shows a clear correspondence of ontologies.},

DSM is now moving toward the operational production of soil maps thanks to a set of researches that have been carried out for the last fifteen years. These researches dealt with various topics: the production and processing of soil covariates, the collection of soil data, the development of numerical models of soil prediction, the evaluation of the quality of digital soil maps and the representation of digital soil maps. The recent advances and open questions within each of these topics are successively examined. The emergence of DSM as a credible alternative to fulfill the increasing world-wide demand in spatial soil data is conditioned to its ability to (i) increase spatial resolutions and enlarge extents and (ii) deliver a relevant information. The former challenge requires to develop a specific spatial data infrastructure for Digital Soil Mapping, to grasp Digital Soil Mapping onto existing soil survey programs and to develop soil spatial inference systems. The latter challenge requires to map soil function and threats (and not only ?primary? soil properties), to develop a framework for the accuracy assessment of DSM products and to introduce the time dimension.},

We suggest that digital soil mapping, which can be defined as the creation, and population of spatial soil information systems (SSINFOS) by the use of field and laboratory observational methods, coupled with spatial and non-spatial soil inference systems, is the appropriate response. Problems of large extents and soil-cover complexity and coarse resolutions and short-range variability representation carry over from conventional soil survey to digital soil mapping. Meeting users' requests and demands and the ability to deal with spatially variable and temporally evolving datasets must be the key features of any new approach. In this chapter, we present a generic framework that recognises the procedures required. Within quantitatively defined physiographic regions, SSINFOS must be populated and spatial soil inference systems (SSINFERS) must be developed. When combined this will allow users to derive the data they require. Further work is required on the development of these systems, and on the data requirements, the optimal forms of inference and the appropriate representation of the products of digital soil mapping.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) depends on the identification of relationships between soil variables and informative covariates. These have components of variation that correspond to different spatial scales, so an analysis of variation by spatial scale may be both informative and of practical value for improving predictions of soil properties. In this chapter multiresolution analysis on wavelet basis functions is explained and illustrated, using both continuous variables and indicator variables defined on soil classes. A case study is presented in which a decomposition of sensor data on soil electrical conductivity resulted in better predictive models for soil properties. The use of wavelet methods for denoising data is illustrated. Because of the local properties of wavelet coefficients it is possible to smooth noise while retaining local variation at high spatial frequencies that appears to be significant. Finally, it is shown how wavelet packet transforms and best-basis identification can be used to develop a wavelet basis that is adapted to the properties of a particular data set.},

The prediction methods were statistical (linear regression between soil properties and digital values) and geostatistical algorithms (ordinary kriging, ordinary kriging plus regression and kriging with varying local means). Mean square error (MSE) was used to evaluate the performance of the map prediction quality. The best prediction method for mapping organic matter, pH and potassium was kriging with varying local means in combination with the spectral data from the blue waveband with the smallest MSE indicating the highest precision.

  Abstract                 = {This chapter considers both opportunities and constraints to applied, operational digital soil mapping (DSM) from the points of view of a) availability of suitable input data layers, b) protocols available for DSM, c) quality of input data layers and resultant output maps and d) other efforts required to build predictive mapping capacity and apply it effectively. Many potential DSM practitioners are discouraged by the real or perceived lack of availability of suitable input data layers to support DSM, particularly in regions with weakly developed spatial data infrastructures. Solutions to addressing prob- lems of limited or sparse spatial data sets are identified for input layers derived from digital elevation models (DEM?s), remotely sensed imagery and available secondary source maps. A variety of protocols for producing predictive soil maps are discussed under the general headings of unsupervised, supervised and knowledge-based (or heuris- tic) approaches. These key protocol activities support the ability to make maps of the spatial distribution of soil classes or attributes by developing predictive rela- tions between spatially distributed input variables or classes and the desired output classes. Different strategies are reviewed to acquire and formalize tacit knowledge embodied in soil-landform conceptual models and to capture this tacit knowledge as quantitative rules. A considerable amount of resistance to DSM arises from real or perceived con- cerns about the quality of the resulting maps in comparison to existing maps pro- duced using traditional mapping methods. Quality, defined as the ability of a map or product to correctly predict the characteristics of the landscape at particular points or within particular small areas, is discussed as are suitable approaches for evaluating and reporting it. The capacity to apply DSM routinely and operationally requires additional support in the form of training, access to suitable tools and software and access to suitable input data. Approaches to developing support for DSM from decision makers and funding agencies in the face of institutional and discipline resistance to embracing new technologies are identified, specifically incremental projects with clearly de- fined goals and testable measures of success. Finally, it is noted that perhaps the biggest hurdle to building capacity is our own hesitancy to believe in ourselves and to dream big and try big. It is hoped that this chapter will encourage individuals with an interest in applying new predictive mapping techniques to embrace change and to try to create useful, operational maps for large areas in their own regions of interest.},

  Abstract                 = {Growing demand for soil information at fine resolutions led to National Soil Resources Institute (NSRI) investigating environmental modelling as an alternative to traditional field surveys. Training data based on the existing records were subjected to data analysis to deduce modelling rules. Techniques were investigated for one nonglaciated and three glaciated terrains. Problems with several predictive data layers were identified. Very limited numbers of data layers were required to model spatial distribution of soils; and these were landscape driven. The success of extrapolation strategies was related to the extent of identified correspondences between trial and test areas. Relationships were more easily defined for nonglaciated areas.},

  Abstract                 = {We review various recent approaches to making digital soil maps based on geographic information systems (GIS) data layers, note some commonalities and propose a generic framework for the future. We discuss the various methods that have been, or could be, used for fitting quantitative relationships between soil properties or classes and their ?environment?. These include generalised linear models, classification and regression trees, neural networks, fuzzy systems and geostatistics. We also review the data layers that have been, or could be, used to describe the ?environment?. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models, and spectral reflectance bands from satellite imagery, have been the most commonly used, but there is a large potential for new data layers. The generic framework, which we call the scorpan-SSPFe (soil spatial prediction function with spatially autocorrelated errors) method, is particularly relevant for those places where soil resource information is limited. It is based on the seven predictive scorpan factors, a generalisation of Jenny?s five factors, namely: (1) s: soil, other or previously measured attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation; (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material, including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic position. Interactions (*) between these factors are also considered. The scorpan-SSPFe method essentially involves the following steps: (i) Define soil attribute(s) of interest and decide resolution q and block size b. (ii) Assemble data layers to represent Q. (iii) Spatial decomposition or lagging of data layers. (iv) Sampling of assembled data (Q) to obtain sampling sites. (v) GPS field sampling and laboratory analysis to obtain soil class or property data. (vi) Fit quantitative relationships (observing Ockham?s razor) with autocorrelated errors. (vii) Predict digital map. (viii) Field sampling and laboratory analysis for corroboration and quality testing. (ix) If necessary, simplify legend or decrease resolution by returning to (i) or improve map by returning to (v). Finally, possible applications, problems and improvements are discussed.},

One of the challenges is to express narratives of pedogenesis in an explicit form that can be incorporated into digital soil mapping. We present an applied example where such a narrative is developed - it emphasizes landscape history, provenance of soil parent materials and pedogenic process. The narrative is then expressed as rules that are used to produce digital soil maps. The rules are parsimonious; they encourage testing and enable spatial prediction; and are easy to update. The rules rely on just a few terrain and geophysical variables. We demonstrate how a new terrain variable, the multiresolution valley-bottom flatness (MrVBF) index, can be used with the familiar topographic wetness index (TWI), to map geomorphic and soil features.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional survey methods have efficiencies in medium to low intensity survey because they use relationships between soil properties and more readily observable environmental features as a basis for mapping. However, the implicit predictive models are qualitative, complex and rarely communicated in a clear manner. The possibility of developing an explicit analogue of conventional survey practice suited to medium to low intensity surveys is considered. A key feature is the use of quantitative environmental variables from digital terrain analysis and airborne gamma radiometric remote sensing to predict the spatial distribution of soil properties. The use of these technologies for quantitative soil survey is illustrated using an example from the Bago and Maragle State Forests in southeastern Australia. A design-based, stratified, two-stage sampling scheme was adopted for the 50,000 ha area using digital geology, landform and climate as stratifying variables. The landform and climate variables were generated using a high resolution digital elevation model with a grid size of 25 m. Site and soil data were obtained from 165 sites. Regression trees and generalised linear models were then used to generate spatial predictions of soil properties using digital terrain and gamma radiometric survey data as explanatory variables. The resulting environmental correlation models generate spatial predictions with a fine grain unmatched by comparable conventional survey methods. Example models and spatial predictions are presented for soil profile depth, total phosphorus and total carbon. The models account for 42%, 78% and 54% of the variance present in the sample respectively. The role of spatial dependence, issues of scale and landscape complexity are discussed along with the capture of expert knowledge. It is suggested that environmental correlation models may form a useful trend model for various forms of kriging if spatial dependence is evident in the residuals of the model.},

These soil data were collected for other purposes and there were only limited soil bulk den- sity data (103), which is needed for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) were estimated to be used in the modeling of organic soil carbon of topsoil (0?10 cm), using the scorpan model. The following environ- mental correlates were used as predictor variables: satellite data (Landsat ETM+), lithology and soil maps, and a DEM and its derivatives. This dataset represents the best organized soil dataset in Brazil and is working as an educational trial for Digital Soil Mapping using a variety of methods for predicting soil classes and their properties. Multilinear analysis and regression-kriging were used to perform the modeling. Seven different models were built and compared through statistical methods. The main difference between the models was the set of predictor variables used to perform them. In general, all models performed well to predict the SOC stock. Nevertheless, model 6 was considered the best one since it presented the smallest AIC and RMSE as it used existing soil information (polygon soil maps) as a predictor variable, in addition to the variables used in the other models. The results obtained with this model were used to map topsoil carbon stock at a spatial resolution of 90 m.},

  Abstract                 = {Prediction of soil attributes and soil classes in digital soil mapping relies on finding relationships between soil and the predictor variables of soil-forming factors and processes. The predictor variables can be remotely or proximally sensed images of soil, landscape, parent material or climatic factors. Till date, most prediction methods are based on performing regression on the predictor variables directly to predict soil attributes or classes. There are problems using data layers from different sources, particularly, multicollinearity, and the fact that the relationships between soil and environmental variables can change with spatial scale. To overcome the problem of correlation between variables, principal component analysis can be performed on the predictor variables. With respect to the spatial dependency, each of these variables can be decomposed into separate spatial components and mapped separately. One of the methods of achieving this is wavelet analysis, which decomposes the variables into separate hierarchical spatial components of decreasing spatial resolution. These components could all be derived and subsequently used as separate layers in predicting soil classes or soil attributes. In this chapter, data are decomposed using the wavelet method and examples of predictions of soil classes and surface-clay content are shown, in order to evaluate the effect of using the decomposed layers in comparison with the original data.},

  Abstract                 = {In this chapter, we shall discuss about the state of the art of the Brazilian soil survey and mapping, including a brief history of soil surveys in Brazil, a summary description of survey methods and techniques, mapping paradigms, as well as the present-day needs and current challenges. Digital soil mapping is viewed as an opportunity to recover the unaccomplished soil mapping program in Brazil. We also focus on several attempts to make a national soil database, starting at the beginning of the 1980s with SisSolos, followed by SigSolos, and lately, SigWeb #Iniciativa##Solos##br#, available at http://www.cnps.embrapa.br/soilsbr and the country's new challenges to improve soil mapping, as well as some insights into digital soil mapping. Traditional soil surveys in Brazil have covered almost the whole country; these soil surveys are mainly in small-scale mapping, except for the Amazon region, which is poorly provided with soil surveys. Four main governmental institutions, Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), Agronomic Institute of Campinas (IAC) and Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM), execute soil surveys at the national and state levels. Private consultants also perform soil surveys, particularly on larger scales, under private contracts. Consequently, there is much dispersed information about soil surveys, but at least the methods and procedures are kept reasonably uniform all over the country. The systematic, governmental-supported soil mapping of the entire country, as initially planned, has been cancelled for a long time, although the demand for soil survey information continues at the same or even higher levels in some regions. At present, complete soil mapping covers 17 states out of 26, and the Federal District, at scales ranging from 1:100,000 to 1:600,000, covers approximately 35% of Brazilian soil, as well as a full uniform cover at scales of 1:1,000,000 and 1:5,000,000. Extensive zones still lack complete soil information at suitable scales and survey levels, needed to face the current problems of use, management, conservation, prevention and recovery of agriculturally and nonagriculturally degraded areas. Nowadays, soil surveys are made only on governmental demands, to support agroecological zonings and evaluation of environmental-impact projects, precision agriculture, degraded-area reclamation, planning of rural settlements and land-use planning, and are always linked to multidisciplinary activities. Soil and environmental data organisation, structuring and availability is imperative to perform digital soil mapping, which will certainly generate demands of quality databases as well as of the necessary tools for institutions involved in soil surveys in Brazil.},

  Abstract                 = {Prediction of soil attributes (properties and classes) in digital soil mapping (DSM) is based on the correlation between primary soil attributes and secondary environmental attributes. These secondary attributes can be obtained relatively cheaply over large areas. In the presence of these environmental covariates, a strategic sampling design needs to ensure the coverage of the full range of environmental variables. This could enhance the full representation of the expected soil properties or soil classes. This chapter presents the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) as a sampling strategy on existing data layers. LHS is a stratified-random procedure that provides an efficient way of sampling variables from their multivariate distributions. It provides a full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. This method is illustrated with examples from DSM of part of the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. Comparison is made with other methods: random sampling, equal spatial strata and principal component (PC). Results showed that the LHS is the most effective way to replicate the distribution of the variables.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimation and mapping carbon storage in the soil is currently an important topic; thus, the knowledge of the distribution of carbon content with depth is essential. This paper examines the use of a negative exponential profile depth function to describe the soil carbon data at different depths, and its integral to represent the carbon storage. A novel method is then proposed for mapping the soil carbon storage in the Lower Namoi Valley, NSW. This involves deriving pedotransfer functions to predict soil organic carbon and bulk density, fitting the exponential depth function to the carbon profile data, deriving a neural network model to predict parameters of the exponential function from environmental data, and mapping the organic carbon storage. The exponential depth function is shown to fit the soil carbon data adequately, and the parameters also reflect the influence of soil order. The parameters of the exponential depth function were predicted from land use, radiometric K, and terrain attributes. Using the estimated parameters we map the carbon storage of the area from surface to a depth of 1 m. The organic carbon storage map shows the high influence of land use on the predicted storage. Values of 15?22 kg/m2 were predicted for the forested area and 2?6 kg/m2 in the cultivated area in the plains.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital soil mapping techniques appear to be an interesting alternative for traditional soil survey techniques. However, most applications deal with (semi-)detailed soil surveys where soil variability is determined by a limited number of soil forming factors. The question that remains is whether digital soil mapping techniques are equally suitable for exploratory or reconnaissance soil surveys in more extensive areas with limited data availability. We applied digital soil mapping in a 13,500 km2 study area in Kenya with the main aim to create a reconnaissance soil map to assess clay and soil organic carbon contents in terraced maize fields. Soil spatial variability prediction was based on environmental correlation using the concepts of the soil forming factors equation. During field work, 95 composite soil samples were collected. Auxiliary spatially exhaustive data provided insight on the spatial variation of climate, land cover, topography and parent material. The final digital soil maps were elaborated using regression kriging. The variance explained by the regression kriging models was estimated as 13% and 37% for soil organic carbon and clay respectively. These results were confirmed by cross-validation and provide a significant improvement compared to the existing soil survey.},

  Abstract                 = {This article reviews the use of optical and microwave remote sensing data for soil and terrain mapping with emphasis on applications at regional and coarser scales. Remote sensing is expected to offer possibilities for improving incomplete spatial and thematic coverage of current regional and global soil databases. Traditionally, remotely sensed imagery have been used to support segmentation of the landscape into rather homogeneous soil?landscape units for which soil composition can be established by sampling. Soil properties have also been inferred from optical and microwave data using physically-based and empirical methods. Used as a secondary data source, remotely sensed imagery may support spatial interpolation of sparsely sampled soil property data. Soil properties that have been measured using remote or proximal sensing approaches include mineralogy, texture, soil iron, soil moisture, soil organic carbon, soil salinity and carbonate content. In sparsely vegetated areas, successful use of space borne, airborne, and in situ measurements using optical, passive and active microwave instruments has been reported. On the other hand, in densely vegetated areas, soil data acquisition typically relied on indirect retrievals using soil indicators, such as plant functional groups, productivity changes, and Ellenberg indicator values. Several forms of kriging, classification and regression tree analyses have been used jointly with remotely sensed data to predict soil properties at unvisited locations aiming at obtaining continuous area coverage. We expect that remotely sensed data from existing platforms and planned missions can provide an important data source supporting digital soil mapping. Yet, most studies so far have been performed on a local scale and only few on regional or smaller map scale. Although progress has been made, current methods and techniques still bear potential to further explore the full range of spectral, spatial and temporal properties of existing data sources. For example, space borne spectroscopy has been of limited use in retrieving soil data when compared to laboratory or field spectroscopy. To date, there is no coherent methodology established, where approaches of spatial segmentation, measurements of soil properties and interpolation using remotely sensed data are integrated in a holistic fashion to achieve complete area coverage. Such approaches will enhance the perspectives of using remotely sensed data for digital soil mapping.},

  Abstract                 = {Remotely sensed data might be an important tool for acquiring geographical information about soil attributes especially in areas where the soil surface is permanently or temporarily exposed, as in the extensive vineyard region of the Languedoc Roussillon region of France. By providing detailed spectral signature for every pixel, imaging spectrometry can potentially be used to identify the nature and abundance of some soil surface components. This chapter reports results obtained in the analysis of soil spectral data of the Low Languedoc Plains natural region of southern France acquired by an image spectrometer (Hyperspectral Mapper - HyMap) after laboratory calibration to make quantitative estimations of CaCO3 and clay content of surface soil horizons. Two different approaches for extracting information from soil reflectance spectra were used: (a) band depth analysis for estimating calcium carbonate and clay abundances and (b) a redness index to identify soil colour variations. Validation data are available on surface soil samples as visible-NIR and X-ray spectra, and chemical characterisations. For areas with soils developed from sedimentary materials of variable calcium carbonate and particle-size composition, we have demonstrated the possibility of obtaining quantitative information for CaCO3 content from the intensity of absorption of the feature centred at 2341 nm. CaCO3 estimates were highly satisfactory and at least as good as field effervescence test usually used in fieldwork. Clay particle-size content classes can also be estimated using the absorption depth of the clay minerals absorption feature at 2206 nm. Redness index along with clay and CaCO3 estimates allows characterisation and explanation of the intra-unit variability of a pre-existing 1:100,000 soil map, and could be further used as new covariates in order to refine limits or segment existing units.},

The methodology was developed and based on the soil-land inference model – SoLIM, on the soil factor equation and the soil-landscape model. The fuzzy logic is able to simulate the uncertainty and transitions that often appear in pedologic systems. The results show that the methodology allows the generation of digital soil maps with increased scale and to reduce soil classe generalizations in the space and parameter domain.

  Abstract                 = {The application of statistical techniques to spatially predicting soil attributes from ancillary variables evolved from Jenny's factors of soil formation, termed Climate, Organisms, Relief, Parent material and Time or corpt. The corpt approach was recently extended to include other soil attributes (s as surrogates) and space (n), and thus it is termed scorpan with time factor t in corpt replaced as age (a). The main objectives of this chapter are to collate and integrate various land feature digital layers to the same resolution and coordinate system, and to develop spatial prediction models based on scorpan and scorpan-kriging methods, for predicting selected soil attributes. Existing analogue maps were first digitised and transformed into digital maps. These, along with other existing digital information, were reprojected in the same coordinate system, the Geocentric Datum of Australia (1994) and Map Grid of Australia (1994), namely GDA-94 and MGA-94. Further these digital map layers, along with Landsat bands and digital terrain attributes, were used to predict soil attributes and thus producing different soil attribute maps for a number of soil depths. The spatial prediction methods used were scorpan methods, such as multiple linear regressions (MLR) and scorpan-kriging (SK), which combines simple kriging with MLR. While MLR was good enough model to predict a number of soil attributes, SK was more appropriate for electrical conductivity for two layers: 0-10 and 70-80 cm layers and was equally good, if not slightly better than the scorpan technique of MLR. However, the results of scorpan-kriging exhibit more detailed variation across the extent of the study area compared with kriging or MLR. The application of generalised linear and generalised additive models did not improve the prediction accuracy. Two of the soil attributes - clay content and electrical conductivity - for both the topsoil (0-10-cm depth) and subsoil (70-80-cm depth) are illustrated here. Both soil attributes have significant influence on the hydrological processes shaping the landscape. Finally, the digital land feature maps, including those of soil and digital terrain attributes, are displayed as geographical information systems (GIS) layers, which could potentially be useful for various environmental and catchment modelling.},

  Abstract                 = {The soil survey includes a description of the morphological, physical and chemical properties of soils in a given area, including technical description and interdisciplinary information, and supporting various purposes. The digital soil mapping makes possible to improve the products of pedological surveys through the use of geographic information system (GIS) tools, and knowledge of the soil genesis, morphology and classification, in regards the choice of attributes that represent a consistent approach to the reality, and seeking to produce a precise soil survey with efficiency (cost x time). The overall objective of this study was to characterize the landscape components to subsidizethe prediction of soil classes, using artificial neural networks (ANN's), to produce the digital soil map of the Rio Guapi-Macacu watershed, located in Rio de Janeiro State. The mapping involved 100 sample points which were analysed for chemical and physical propertiesandmorphological described, according to standard soil surveys methods in Brazil. The digital soil mapping involved the acquisition ofcartographic database, creating digital models that represent landscape attributes relevant to pedogenesis and soil classification, analysis ofsoil-landscape relationships, and ultimately supervised classification by ANN and validation of the mapping result. Given the approach usedand the processing tools of the data available, the digital elevation models (DEM's) were analysed, for the spatial resolution and how to acquire the model, to select the appropriate DEM to derive the morphometric attributes. The analyses showed as having superior quality the DEM with appropriate spatial resolution of 30m cell size, obtained by interpolation of elevation data, contour lines and elevation points,SRTM sensor data. After defining the MDE and derivation of attributes, a study was made for recognition of patterns and geomorphic characterization of pedoenvironment involving sample collection and description of profiles in predefined locations, through theprogram Hypercube Latin Conditioned Sampling (cLHS). The predominant soils were: Oxisols, Ultisols, Inceptisols, Aquents and other Entisols.The usage of GIS tools allowed the selection of variables to compose sets of discriminants used in the classification stage by ANN. Theselected variables were: altimetry, slope, curvature, combined topographic index, euclidean distance, clay minerals, iron oxide, NDVI and geology. There were trained eleven sets of ANN's, with different combinations as to the discriminating variables (input layer). Thecriteria used in evaluating the performance of the ANN were the rates of overall accuracy and Kappa, considering the generalization of outputclasses. Validation was performed using 120 control points corresponding to the soil profiles that were not used for ANN training. Afterthe analysis of the mean square error of the different sets, the architecture with 10 hidden nodes was chosen. The evaluation criteria ofclassification underlined the best networks performance of the sets 1, 7 and 10, corresponding to all variables, excluding the geology, andexcluding the index NDVI, which did not differ. The generalization and validation showed that the set 10 allowed the best final classification.},

With this aim, we define #soilscapes# (pédopaysages) as complex spatial objects observable at a determined spatial resolution and potentially recognisable by an original composition of landscape elements, the co-occurrence and topological relationships of these elements or the size of their spatial pattern. The proposed approach describes each point to be mapped by characteristics of its spatial neighbourhood and allocates it to pre-defined reference classes using a mathematical distance. The result is a numeric dashboard with continuous and crisp maps, graphs and cartographic and statistical quality indicators. An application example presents a small-scale cartographic sketch, as required by a French inventory program (Inventaire, Gestion et Conservation des Sols de France, IGCS), delineating soilscape units on a 50,000-ha area of southern France from 50-m resolution lithological map and topographical derivatives. A satisfactory agreement is found with an existing soilscape map made by trained surveyors.

(Projeto Carbono_RJ, sponsored by FAPERJ ? Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support in Rio de Janeiro State). These soil data were collected for other purposes and there were only limited soil bulk den- sity data (103), which is needed for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) were estimated to be used in the modeling of organic soil carbon of topsoil (0?10 cm), using the scorpan model. The following environ- mental correlates were used as predictor variables: satellite data (Landsat ETM+), lithology and soil maps, and a DEM and its derivatives. This dataset represents the best organized soil dataset in Brazil and is working as an educational trial for Digital Soil Mapping using a variety of methods for predicting soil classes and their properties. Multilinear analysis and regression-kriging were used to perform the modeling. Seven different models were built and compared through statistical methods. The main difference between the models was the set of predictor variables used to perform them. In general, all models performed well to predict the SOC stock. Nevertheless, model 6 was considered the best one since it presented the smallest AIC and RMSE as it used existing soil information (polygon soil maps) as a predictor variable, in addition to the variables used in the other models. The results obtained with this model were used to map topsoil carbon stock at a spatial resolution of 90 m.},

  Abstract                 = {Within the scope of environmental features, it is widely accepted that the use of topographical criteria, which are easily devised and measured, favor the definition and delimitation of indicative compartments of certain soil attributes. The major goal of the present study, situated inurban area and expansion fronts of Goiania and centered on digital terrain modeling based on morphometric data and borehole logs, is the understanding of the spatial distribution of unconsolidated materials, which are scarcely exposed in densely occupied areas. With thisrespect, it is also the expectation of this work to methodologically contribute to the engineering geological mapping, through the association of information relative to terrain modeling and conventional soil condition mapping. To this end, alphanumerical data from sub-surfaceinvestigations, comprising information regarding unconsolidated materials, bedrock, and relief features, were georeferenced to a digital cartographic basis and stored into a geographical information system (GIS). In particular, digital terrain models (DTM) based on themanipulation of altimetric data and according to geomorphometric criteria, are presented. Such models, encompasses for each matrix cell (morphometric point), the following elementary morphometric indices: altitude, gradient, aspect and slope curvatures. In addition, eachcell also contains information relative to the surface (morphometric object), aiming at the characterization of the relief concerning its entropy, a concept related to the altimetric amplitude of a given neighboring region. From the alphanumerical databasis of the geotechnical core drilling, in association to altimetric information, it was possible to delineate a panorama concerning the distribution of the dynamic penetration index (Nspt) at certain depths, as well as of the thickness of the unconsolidated materials and the water level, according to the respective morphometric attributes.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years thematic mapping has undergone a revolution as the result of advances in geographic information science and remote sensing. However, mapping of soil types and characteristics has not fully shared in this revolution, because of the complexity of soil geography and the high cost of its direct observation. None the less, the demand for soil information has never been higher, since the soil resource is so important for rural and urban planning, for environmental protection, and to understand water and geochemical cycles. This paper reviews the advances which are leading towards multiple-use soil information systems. These advances include: (1) low-cost, wide-area data, especially elevations and spectral reﬂectances; (2) direct digital remote sensing of soil properties; (3) geostatistical interpolation and sampling design; (4) terrain modelling; (5) predictive soil mapping; (6) data integration; (7) pedotransfer functions and soil inference systems; (8) powerful desktop computing environments; (9) the Internet. The challenge is to integrate these advances into operational systems that respond to the extensive actual and latent demand for soil information.},

The new area is in the Green River Basin of Wyoming, USA, which has greater variability in parent material, lower erosion rates and a colder climate than the Powder River Basin of Johnson County, Wyoming, where the PURC approach was developed. There is also a lack of existing soil survey data within or adjacent to the new study area. Topographic data derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) and various band combinations and ratios of Landsat 7 remotely sensed spectral data were selected to represent soil-forming factors. Unsupervised classification techniques were used in the preliminary stage of the methodology to recognise existing soil-landscape patterns and to develop an initial sampling plan. Knowledge-based classification and classification tree analysis were used to develop models predicting soil delineations and quantifying soil map unit concepts. The output images generated from the knowledge-based and classification tree models produced similar predictions of soil patterns across the landscape, with slightly different predictions of soil map units. However, the knowledge-based model was much more time-intensive than the classification trees, and failed to classify all pixels within the study area even after multiple iterations of the model. Classification tree analysis was successfully integrated into the methodology, and is more objective than the knowledge-based classification. Although finals maps were slightly different, both models were transparent and could be further refined as additional data becomes available or as land-use needs change.},

For example, advances in geographic information science, digital terrain modeling, remote sensing, fuzzy logic has created a tremendous potential for improvement in the way that soil maps are produced. The State Factor soil-forming model, which was introduced to the western world by one of the early Presidents of the American Association of Geographers (C.F. Marbut), forms the theoretical basis of PSM. PSM research is being driven by a need to understand the role soil plays in the biophysical and biogeochemical functioning of the planet. Much research has been published on the subject in the last 20 years (mostly outside of geographic journals) and methods have varied widely from statistical approaches (including geostatistics) to more complex methods, such as decision tree analysis, and expert systems. A geographic perspective is needed because of the inherently geographic nature of PSM.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital soil mapping is critical when quantifying the relationship between soil types and their associated bio-physical environments. Digital mapping of regional soils affected by salt is essential when monitoring the dynamics of soil salts and planning land development and reclamatation schemes. In this paper, an easy method for digitally mapping salt-affected soils is proposed. This method allows the construction of the quantitative lower categories of soil classification based on Chinese Soil Taxonomy by using a geostatistical method and GIS technology. The data and maps used in this study were collected during a soil survey of salt-affected desert agro-ecological zones in Karamay, Xinjiang Autonomous Region, China. The survey covers an area of 525 km2 and includes 205 soil profiles. In addition, a classification and indicator system for the salt-affected soil in the region was established and 30 saltaffected soil types were identified. Three key soil classification indicators, viz. soil texture, texture stratification combination and total soil salinity, were selected to enable low-category soil classification. Furthermore, the information regarding climate, vegetation and topographic and geomorphologic features of the region was integrated into the analysis. A GIS-based regional digital soil classification map was then generated for three layers (0?30 cm, 30?60 cm, and 60?100 cm) after the observed soil salt distribution map and soil texture stratification maps were overlaid. This map would be used to draw up the strategies of the salt-affected soils improvement in desert. While compared with the conventional approaches, this new digital soil mapping method has the advantages of being prompt, quantitative, more objective, simpler and easier to update.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a method for optimizing sampling for digital soil mapping in cases where no directly measured prior information of the primary variable of interest is available. Various ancillary variables (soil series, relative elevation, slope, electrical conductivity and soil surface reflectance) were assumed to provide indirect information about the spatial distribution of soil carbon stock (CS, Mg ha1 in 0-0.3 m depth) in three fields of 49 to 65 ha size. The secondary information was used for stratifying each field into contiguous spatial clusters. Using this stratification, initial stratified random sampling schemes were allocated and further optimized by constrained spatial simulated annealing. Three optimization approaches were evaluated: minimization of the shortest distance (MMSD), a uniform distribution of point pairs for variogram estimation (WM), and a combination of MMSD (2 /3 of samples) and WM (1 / 3). Spatially constrained cluster analysis of secondary information resulted in stratifications that accounted for large proportions of the variation of all ancillary variables used in the cluster analysis, but also for 47% to 68% of the spatial variation in measured CS. MMSD-optimized sampling schemes were inappropriate for mapping when the sampling density was low (V1.5 to 2 samples per hectare) because spatial variation occurring at short lag distances was poorly resolved. WM-optimized sampling schemes allowed modeling of spatial variation, but resulted in poor field coverage for mapping purposes. The combined MMSD+WM optimization provided both even field coverage and the ability to estimate variograms for interpolation purposes. Sampling based on secondary information and re-use of the secondary information in regression kriging increased the accuracy of CS maps and allowed a significant reduction in sample size without loss of information. Further improvements could include fitness functions that simultaneously account for variation in feature and geographic space as well as sampling cost.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital soil mapping approaches that require quantitative data for prediction are difficult to implement in countries with limited data on soil and auxiliary variables. However, in many such cases there is a wealth of qualitative information available, such as profile descriptions, catenas or general purpose soil surveys. This type of information opens possibilities for more qualitative approaches to digital soil mapping when quantitative mapping is unfeasible. In this study we used a classification tree approach combined with literature and a small dataset of 40 point SOC observations to map the topsoil organic carbon (SOC) content for a data-poor environment in the Senegalese Peanut Basin. A literature review provided an overview of the driving factors of soil variability in the Peanut Basin. Geomorphology, topography, vegetation, and land use were identified as the main factors explaining the spatial variation of SOC in the Peanut Basin. These factors were represented in a classification tree by variables that were derived from a digital elevation model and a satellite image. Threshold values and actual predictions for the classification tree were based on literature and the small soil dataset. Next the classification tree was used to create a map of SOC for the study area. Using cluster random sampling, 155 locations were sampled for validation. Validation of the model results showed a poor model performance with large prediction errors. Error analysis showed that although the variables that were used to predict SOC were important sources of variability, a larger soil dataset is needed to better calibrate the classification tree model. Calibration of the classification tree on the basis of the validation dataset produced much improvement and acceptable results after cross-validation. It is concluded that digital soil mapping on the basis of existing knowledge and general auxiliary information is feasible, provided that a sufficiently large and appropriately collected soil dataset is available for calibration.},

  Abstract                 = {Sustainable land management and land use planning require reliable information about the spatial distribution of the physical and chemical soil properties affecting both landscape processes and services. Although many studies have been conducted to identify the spatial patterns of soil property distribution on various scales and in various landscapes, only little is known about the relationships underlying the spatial distribution of soil properties in intensively used, finely structured paddy soil landscapes in the southeastern part of China. In order to provide adequate soil information for the modelling of landscape processes, such as soil water movement, nutrient leaching, soil erosion and plant growth, this study investigates to what extent cheap and readily available ancillary information derived from digital elevation models and remote sensing data can be used to support soil mapping and to indicate soil characteristics on the landscape scale. This article focuses on the spatial prediction of the total carbon and nitrogen content and of physical soil properties such as topsoil silt, sand and clay content, topsoil depth and plough pan thickness. Correlation analyses indicate that, on the one side, the distribution of C, N and silt contents is quite closely related to the NDVI of vegetated surfaces and that, on the other side, it corresponds significantly to terrain attributes such as relative elevation, elevation above nearest drainage channel and topographical wetness index. Geostatistical analyses furthermore reflect a moderately structured spatial correlation of these soil variables. The combined use of the above mentioned terrain variables and the NDVI in a multiple linear regression accounted for 29% (silt) to 41% (total C) of the variance of these soil properties. In order to select the best prediction method to accurately map soil property distribution, we compared the performance of different regionalization techniques, such as multi-linear regression, simple kriging, inverse distance to a power, ordinary kriging and regression kriging. Except for the prediction of topsoil clay content, in all cases regression kriging model ??C?? performed best. Compared to simple kriging, the spatial prediction was improved by up to 14% (total C), 13% (total N) and 10% (silt). Since the autocorrelation lengths of these spatially well correlated soil variables range between three and five times the soil sampling density, we consider regression kriging model ??C?? to be a suitable method for reducing the soil sampling density. It should help to save time and costs when doing soil mapping on the landscape scale, even in intensively used paddy soil landscapes.},

  Abstract                 = {In Australia, soil salinity is one of the most devastating forms of land degradation facing agricultural production. In northern New South Wales (NSW), where irrigated-cotton production is a dominant agricultural commodity, salinity even though is not currently such a serious problem, could pose a potential threat to cotton production. This chapter explores the use of discriminant analysis (DA) and other alternative models for using ancillary data to create threshold-based risk maps (rather than continuous maps) of soil salinity and compares these maps with more traditional indicator predictions. The opportunity for incorporating an error analysis into DA is also explored. The hypothesis for including the error analysis in DA and related models is that a certain level of information remains in the residuals of the initial model and that this information could be extracted and analysed to improve the final prediction. The ancillary-based models used in this chapter did not produce better predictions than a Multi-Indicator Kriging (MIK) approach that did not include the ancillary data. The DA models produced better prediction than the Multi-Variate Stepwise Linear Regression with the Kriging (MSLR-K) and Binomial Linear Regression models. A benefit of the DA approaches is the generation of probability maps, similar to MIK, that may be used in future decision making.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter emphasises the geomorphological component to landscape modelling and simulation for soil resource assessment. This concept views the soil resource as a dynamic 3-dimensional geomorphological landscape and presents information as regolith-terrain (R-T) data in the context of Regolith-Catenary Units (RCUs) in an explicit and repeatable process. RCUs are 3-dimensional R-T systems and are viewed as composite R-T entities. They are described through soil geomorphic techniques. Observations of the regolith are limited, so conceptual models of the R-T as RCUs are necessary. Spatial expression of RCUs is achieved through the predictive capabilities of digital terrain analysis using derivative functions from digital terrain models. Landform attributes are combined as RCU components through a set of fuzzy rules to form simulated RCUs. These are closer to the conceptual and linguistic definition of hillslope components and their geomorphic processes. The concept is applied to predicting soil and regolith attributes derived through fuzzy classification to produce continuous data surfaces for a forested terrain in southeast Queensland. These then serve as decision support [`]maps' of the R-T attributes that relate directly to site-specific management of the forest land resource},

  Abstract                 = {High-resolution digital soil mapping for applications like precision agriculture requires the collection of good-quality high spatial resolution information. Conventional soil analysis is expensive, time consuming and laborious. The development of proximal soil sensors to lessen the need for or to complement conventional soil analysis is important. Although proximal sensing may produce results that are not as accurate as conventional laboratory analysis, they allow for the collection of larger amounts of data using simpler, cheaper and less laborious techniques. This forms the rationale for proximal soil sensing. This article deals with indirect measurements of soil organic carbon (OC) and iron (Fe) contents using soil colour as the proxy. Measurements of soil colour were made using a digital camera. The RGB tristimuli were transformed to variables from other colour space models and a redness index (RI) and these were used to derive pedotransfer functions for soil OC and Fe. Predictions using univariate as well as full factorial regressions (FFR) of these tristimuli were compared to predictions using visible-near infrared (vis-NIR: 400-1100 nm) spectra with partial least squares regression (PLSR) and a reduced number of wavelengths selected using the variable importance for projection (VIP) with PLSR (VIP-PLSR). For predictions of soil OC content, the VIP-PLSR technique produced predictions with R2adj. and RMSE values of 0.91 and 0.46%. These were only very slightly better than predictions by an FFR of the CIELa*b* tristimuli (R2adj. of 0.91 and an RMSE of 0.48%) and PLSR (R2adj. of 0.91 and an RMSE of 0.50%). Predictions using the logarithmic regression of the CIEv* variable were least accurate with R2adj. and RMSE values of 0.88 and 0.56%. For predictions of Fe, an FFR of the CIELc*h* tristimuli produced an R2adj. of 0.71 and an RMSE of 0.068%, which was better than those obtained by PLSR (R2adj. values of 0.64 and RMSE 0.074%) and VIP-PLSR (R2adj. of 0.64 and 0.075%). Predictions of Fe using the logarithmic regression of the RI produced the least accurate results with R2adj. and RMSE values of 0.56 and 0.081%. In this study, we showed that a digital camera can be used for fast, accurate and non-destructive measurements of soil colour and predictions of soil OC and Fe contents in Brittany, France.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in on-the-go soil sensing, terrain modelling and yield mapping have made available large quantities of information about the within-field variability of soil and crop properties. But the selection of the key variables for an identification of management zones, required for precision agriculture, is not straightforward. To investigate a procedure for this selection, an 8 ha agricultural field in the Loess belt of Belgium was considered for this study. The available information consisted of: (i) top- and subsoil samples taken at 110 locations, on which soil properties: textural fractions, organic carbon (OC), CaCO3 and pH were analysed, (ii) soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) obtained through an electromagnetic induction based sensor, and (iii) wetness index, stream power index and steepest slope angle derived from a detailed digital elevation model (DEM). A principal component analysis, involving 12 soil and topographic properties and two ECa variables, identified three components explaining 67.4% of the total variability. These three components were best represented by pH, ECa that strongly associated with texture and OC. However, OC was closely related to some more readily obtainable topographic properties, and therefore elevation was preferred. A fuzzy k-means classification of these three variables produced four potential management classes. Three-year average standardized yield maps of grain and straw showed productivity differences across these classes, but mainly linked to their landscape position. In the loess area with complex soil-landscape interactions pH, ECa and elevation can be considered as key properties to delineate potential management classes.},

  Abstract                 = {Classical soil survey usually integrated existing pedological knowledge to enhance its efficiency and compensate for very low standard sampling densities. This approach has been criticised because the information taken into account was not explicitly specified and validation procedures were not developed. We advocate that pedological knowledge of soil landscape distribution, soil-forming factors and soil processes is essential to modern soil spatial analysis and may be rigorously integrated into soil mapping. Basic reasons for such integration are an increase in prediction efficiency and also the necessity to link soil maps to dynamic modelling, enabling risk assessment and impact studies. Several approaches are reviewed including spatial prediction techniques using existing soil maps and spatial modelling based on soil-forming factors. Combination in the near future of space and time modelling demands additional integration of the dynamics of physical and biochemical soil processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry is a passive remote sensing technique that measures the natural emission of gamma-ray radiation from the upper 30 cm of the earth's surface. The principle gamma-ray emitting isotopes used in airborne geophysical surveys are 40K, and the 232Th and 238U decay series. These are used to estimate potassium, thorium and uranium abundances, respectively. Gamma rays emitted from the earth's surface mainly relate to the mineralogy and geochemistry of the bedrock and weathered materials (e.g. soils, saprolite, alluvial and colluvial sediments). Gamma-ray imagery can thus be regarded as a surface geochemical map showing the distribution of the radionuclides in rocks, regolith and soil. Where the bedrock contains K-bearing minerals, the loss of K in the soil can often be used as a surrogate for mapping the degree of surface weathering and leaching. Potassium is also associated with potassic clays such as illite, and can be found in smaller amounts where it is absorbed onto clays such as montmorillonite and kaolinite. In contrast, U and Th are often associated with more stable weathered constitutes in the soil profile. Uranium and Th released during weathering are readily absorbed onto clay minerals, oxides (Fe and Al) and organic matter in soils. Elevated U and Th can also be associated with resistate minerals. Therefore, Th and U concentrations often increase as K decreases during bedrock weathering and soil formation. In erosional landscapes the gamma-ray response will relate mainly to mineralogy and geochemistry of the bedrock, weathering characteristics and both past and present landscape processes. Responses of soils in depositional landscapes will reflect the geochemistry and mineralogy of the source rocks, or regolith, from which the sediments are derived, and the sorting of the sediments and weathering of the sediments after deposition. In both erosional and depositional landscapes, when the radioelement characteristic of the sources are well understood, gamma-ray data can be used to predict specific soil characteristics and provide information about erosional, depositional and weathering processes},
